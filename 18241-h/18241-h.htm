<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>It is somewhat curious that among the great number of books on occult science
and all forms of divination which have been published in the English language
there should be none dealing exclusively with the Tea-cup Reading and the Art of
Telling Fortunes by the Tea-leaves: notwithstanding that it is one of the most
common forms of divination practised by the peasants of Scotland and by village
fortune-tellers in all parts of this country. In many of the cheaper handbooks
to Fortune-telling by Cards or in other ways only brief references to the
Tea-cup method are given; but only too evidently by writers who are merely
acquainted with it by hearsay and have not made a study of it for themselves.</p>

<p>This is probably because the Reading of the Tea-cups affords but little
opportunity to the Seer of extracting money from credulous folk; a reason why
it was never adopted by the gypsy soothsayers, who preferred the more obviously
lucrative methods of crossing the palm with gold or silver, or of charging a fee
for manipulating a pack of playing-cards.</p>

<p>Reading the Cup is essentially a domestic form of Fortune-telling to be
practised at home, and with success by anyone who will take the trouble to
master the simple rules laid down in these pages: and it is in the hope that it
will provide a basis for much innocent and inexpensive amusement and recreation
round the tea-table at home, as well as for a more serious study of an
interesting subject, that this little guide-book to the science is confidently
offered to the public.</p>

<a name="1"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO THE ART OF DIVINATION FROM TEA-LEAVES</p>

<p>It seems highly probable that at no previous period of the world's history
have there been so many persons as there are at the present moment anxious to
ascertain in advance, if that be humanly possible, a knowledge of at least 'what
a day may bring forth.' The incidence of the greatest of all wars, which has
resulted in sparse news of those from whom they are separated, and produces a
state of uncertainty as to what the future holds in store for each of the
inhabitants of the British Empire, is, of course, responsible for this increase
in a perfectly sane and natural curiosity; with its inevitable result, a desire
to employ any form of divination in the hope that some light may haply be cast
upon the darkness and obscurity of the future.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately the case, as records of the police-courts have recently
shown, that the creation of this demand for foreknowledge of coming events or
for information as to the well-being of distant relatives and friends has
resulted in the abundant supply of the want by scores of pretended
'Fortune-tellers' and diviners of the Future; who, trading upon the credulity
and anxieties of their unfortunate fellow-countrywomen, seek to make a living at
their expense.</p>

<p>Now it is an axiom, which centuries of experience have shown to be as sound
as those of Euclid himself, that the moment the taint of money enters into the
business of reading the Future the accuracy and credit of the Fortune told
disappears. The Fortune-teller no longer possesses the singleness of mind or
purpose necessary to a clear reading of the symbols he or she consults. The
amount of the fee is the first consideration, and this alone is sufficient to
obscure the mental vision and to bias the judgment. This applies to the very
highest and most conscientious of Fortune-tellers&#8212;persons really adept at
foreseeing the future when no taint of monetary reward intervenes. The greater
number, however, of so-called Fortune-tellers are but charlatans, with the
merest smattering of partly-assimilated knowledge of some form of divination or
'character-reading'; whether by the cards, coins, dice, dominoes, hands,
crystal, or in any other pretended way. With these, the taint of the money they
hope to receive clouds such mind or intuition as they may possess, and it
follows that their judgments and prognostications have precisely the same value
as the nostrums of the quack medicine-vendor. They are very different from the
Highlander who, coming to the door of his cottage or bothie at dawn, regards
steadfastly the signs and omens he notes in the appearance of the sky, the
actions of animals, the flight of birds, and so forth, and derives there from a
foresight into the coming events of the opening day. They differ also from the
'spae-wife,' who, manipulating the cup from which she has taken her morning
draught of tea, looks at the various forms and shapes the leaves and dregs have
taken, and deduces thence such simple horary prognostications as the name of the
person from whom 'postie' will presently bring up the glen a letter or a parcel
or a remittance of money; or as to whether she is likely to go a journey, or to
hear news from across the sea, or to obtain a good price for the hose she has
knitted or for the chickens or eggs she is sending to the store-keeper. Here the
taint of a money-payment is altogether absent; and no Highland 'spae-wife' or
seer would dream of taking a fee for looking into the future on behalf of
another person.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that provided he or she is equipped with the requisite
knowledge and some skill and intuition, the persons most fitted to tell
correctly their own fortune are themselves; because they cannot pay themselves
for their own prognostications, and the absence of a monetary taint consequently
leaves the judgment unbiased. Undoubtedly one of the simplest, most inexpensive
and, as the experience of nearly three centuries has proved, most reliable forms
of divination within its own proper limits, is that of reading fortunes in
tea-cups. Although it cannot be of the greatest antiquity, seeing that tea was
not introduced into Britain until the middle of the seventeenth century, and for
many years thereafter was too rare and costly to be used by the great bulk of
the population, the practice of reading the tea-leaves doubtless descends from
the somewhat similar form of divination known to the Greeks as &quot;<font face="Times New Roman"><em>&#954;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#962;</em></font>&quot; by
which fortune in love was discovered by the particular splash made by wine
thrown out of a cup into a metal basin. A few spae-wives still practise this
method by throwing out the tea-leaves into the saucer, but the reading of the
symbols as they are originally formed in the cup is undoubtedly the better
method.</p>

<p>Any person after a study of this book and by carefully following the
principles here laid down may with practice quickly learn to read the horary
fortunes that the tea-leaves foretell. It should be distinctly understood,
however, that tea-cup fortunes are only horary, or dealing with the events of
the hour or the succeeding twenty-four hours at furthest. The immediately
forthcoming events are those which cast their shadows, so to speak, within the
circle of the cup. In this way the tea-leaves may be consulted once a day, and
many of the minor happenings of life foreseen with considerable accuracy,
according to the skill in discerning the symbols and the intuition required to
interpret them which may be possessed by the seer. Adepts like the Highland
peasant-women can and do foretell events that subsequently occur, and that with
remarkable accuracy. Practice and the acquirement of a knowledge of the
signification of the various symbols is all that is necessary in order to become
proficient and to tell one's fortune and that of one's friends with skill and
judgment.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a scientific reason for all forms of divination
practised without hope or promise of reward. Each person carries in himself his
own Destiny. Events do not happen to people by chance, but are invariably the
result of some past cause. For instance, in the last years a man becomes a
soldier who had never intended to pursue a military career. This does not happen
to him by chance, but because of the prior occurrence of la European war in
which his country was engaged. The outbreak of war is similarly the result of
other causes, none of which happened by chance, but were founded by still
remoter occurrences. It is the same with the Future. That which a person does
today as a result of something that happened in the past, will in its turn
prove the cause of something that will happen at some future date. The mere act
of doing something today sets in motion forces that in process of time will
inevitably bring about some entirely unforeseen event.</p>

<p>This event is not decreed by Fate or Providence, but by the person who by the
committal of some act unconsciously compels the occurrence of some future event
which he does not foresee. In other words, a man decrees his own destiny and
shapes his own ends by his actions, whether Providence rough-hew them or not.
Now this being so, it follows that he carries his destiny with him, and the more
powerful his mind and intellect the more clearly is this seen to be the case.
Therefore it is possible for a person's mind, formed as the result of past
events over which he had no control, to foresee by an effort what will occur in
the future as the result of acts deliberately done. Since it is given to but
few, and that not often of intention, to see actually what is about to happen in
a vision or by means of what is called the 'second sight,' some machinery must
be provided in the form of symbols from which an interpretation of the future
can be made. It matters little what the method or nature of the symbols chosen
is&#8212;dice or dominoes, cards or tea-leaves. What matters is that the person
shaking the dice, shuffling the dominoes, cutting the cards or turning the
tea-cup, is by these very acts transferring from his mind where they lie hidden
even from himself the shadows of coming events which by his own actions in the
past he has already predetermined shall occur in the future. It only remains for
someone to read and interpret these symbols correctly in order to ascertain
something of what is likely to happen; and it is here that singleness of purpose
and freedom from ulterior motives are necessary in order to avoid error and to
form a true and clear judgment.</p>

<p>This is the serious and scientific explanation of the little-understood and
less-comprehended action of various forms of divination having for their object
the throwing of a little light upon the occult. Of all these forms perhaps
divination by tea-leaves is the simplest, truest, and most easily learned. Even
if the student is disinclined to attach much importance to what he sees in the
cup, the reading of the tea-leaves forms a sufficiently innocent and amusing
recreation for the breakfast- or tea-table; and the man who finds a lucky sign
such as an anchor or a tree in his cup, or the maiden who discovers a pair of
heart-shaped groups of leaves in conjunction with a ring, will be suffering no
harm in thus deriving encouragement for the future, even should they attach no
importance to their occurrence, but merely treat them as an occasion for
harmless mirth and badinage.</p>

<p>Whether, however, the tea-leaves be consulted seriously or in mere sport and
love of amusement, the methods set forth in succeeding chapters should be
carefully followed, and the significations of the pictures and symbols formed in
the cup scrupulously accepted as correct, for reasons which are explained in a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<a name="2"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II </p>
<p>RITUAL AND METHOD OF USING THE TEA-CUP </p>

<p>The best kind of tea to use if tea-cup reading is to be followed is
undoubtedly China tea, the original tea imported into this country and still the
best for all purposes. Indian tea and the cheaper mixtures contain so much dust
and so many fragments of twigs and stems as often to be quite useless for the
purposes of divination, as they will not combine to form pictures, or symbols
clearly to be discerned.</p>

<p>The best shape of cup to employ is one with a wide opening at the top and a
bottom not too small. Cups with almost perpendicular sides are very difficult to
read, as the symbols cannot be seen properly, and the same may be said of small
cups. A plain-surfaced breakfast-cup is perhaps the best to use; and the
interior should be white and have no pattern printed upon it, as this confuses
the clearness of the picture presented by the leaves, as does any fluting or
eccentricity of shape.</p>

<p>The ritual to be observed is very simple. The tea-drinker should drink the
contents of his or her cup so as to leave only about half a teaspoonful of the
beverage remaining. He should next take the cup by the handle in his left hand,
rim upwards, and turn it three times from left to right in one fairly rapid
swinging movement. He should then very slowly and carefully invert it over the
saucer and leave it there for a minute, so as to permit of all moisture draining
away.</p>

<p>If he approaches the oracle at all seriously he should during the whole of
these proceedings concentrate his mind upon his future Destiny, and 'will' that
the symbols forming under the guidance of his hand and arm (which in their turn
are, of course, directed by his brain) shall correctly represent what is
destined to happen to him in the future.</p>

<p>If, however, he or she is not in such deadly earnest, but merely indulging in
a harmless pastime, such an effort of concentration need not be made. The
'willing' is, of course, akin to 'wishing' when cutting the cards in another
time-honoured form of fortune-telling.</p>

<p>The cup to be read should be held in the hand and turned about in order to
read the symbols without disturbing them, which will not happen if the moisture
has been properly drained away. The handle of the cup represents the consultant
and is akin to the 'house' in divination by the cards. By this fixed point
judgment is made as to events approaching the 'house' of the consultant,
journeys away from home, messages or visitors to be expected, relative distance,
and so forth. The advantage of employing a cup instead of a saucer is here
apparent.</p>

<p>'The bottom of the cup represents the remoter future foretold; the side
events not so far distant; and matters symbolised near the rim those that may be
expected to occur quickly. The nearer the symbols approach the handle in all
three cases the nearer to fulfilment will be the events prognosticated. </p>
<p>If this simple ritual has been correctly carried out the tea-leaves, whether
many or few, will be found distributed about the bottom and sides of the cup.
The fortune may be equally well told whether there are many leaves or few; but
of course there must be some, and therefore the tea should not have been made in
a pot provided with one of the patent arrangements that stop the leaves from
issuing from the spout when the beverage is poured into the cups. There is
nothing to beat one of the plain old-fashioned earthenware teapots, whether for
the purpose of preparing a palatable beverage or for that of providing the means
of telling a fortune.</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III </p>
<p>GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO BE OBSERVED IN READING THE CUP </p>

<p>The interior of the tea-cup when it is ready to be consulted will exhibit the
leaves scattered apparently in a fortuitous and accidental manner, but really in
accordance with the muscular action of the left arm as controlled by the mind at
whose bidding it has worked. These scattered leaves will form lines and circles
of dots or small leaves and dust combined with stems, and groups of leaves in
larger or smaller patches: apparently in meaningless confusion.</p>

<p>Careful notice should now be taken of all the shapes and figures formed
inside the cup. These should be viewed front different positions, so that their
meaning becomes clear. It is not very easy at first to see what the shapes
really are, but after looking at them carefully they become plainer. The
different shapes and figures in the cup must be taken together in a general
reading. Bad indications will be balanced by good ones; some good ones will be
strengthened by others, and so on.</p>

<p>It is now the business of the seer&#8212;whether the consultant or some adept to
whom he has handed the cup to be read&#8212;to find some fairly close resemblance
between the groups formed by the leaves and various natural or artificial
objects. This part of the performance resembles the looking for 'pictures in the
fire' as practised by children in nurseries and school-rooms and occasionally by
people of a larger growth. Actual representations of such things as trees,
animals, birds, anchors, crowns, coffins, flowers, and so forth may by the
exercise of the powers of observation and imagination be discerned, as well as
squares, triangles, and crosses. Each of these possesses, as a symbol, some
fortunate or unfortunate signification. Such signs may be either large or small,
and their relative importance must be judged according to their size. Supposing
the symbol observed should be that indicating the receipt of a legacy, for
instance: if small it would mean that the inheritance would be but trifling, if
large that it would be substantial, while if leaves grouped to form a
resemblance to a coronet accompany the sign for a legacy, a title would probably
descend upon the consultant at the same time. The meaning of all the symbols of
this nature likely to be formed by the fortuitous arrangement of leaves in a
tea-cup is fully set forth in the concluding chapter; and it is unnecessary
therefore to enlarge upon this branch of the subject.</p>

<p>There are, however, several points of a more general character that must be
considered before it is possible to form an accurate judgment of the fortune
displayed. For instance, isolated leaves or groups of a few leaves or stems
frequently form letters of the alphabet or numbers. These letters and numbers
possess meanings which must be sought in conjunction with other signs. If near a
letter L is seen a small square or oblong leaf, or if a number of very small
dots form such a square or oblong, it indicates that a letter or parcel will be
received from somebody whose surname (not Christian name) begins with an L. If
the combined symbol appears near the handle and near the rim of the cup, the
letter is close at hand; if in the bottom there will be delay in its receipt. If
the sign of a letter is accompanied by the appearance of a bird flying towards
the 'house' it means a telegraphic despatch: if flying away from the house the
consultant will have to send the telegram. Birds flying always indicate news of
some sort.</p>

<p>Again, the dust in the tea and the smaller leaves and stems frequently form
lines of dots. These are significant of a journey, and their extent and
direction shows its length and the point of the compass towards which it will
extend: the handle for this purpose being considered as due south. If the
consultant is at home and lines lead from the handle right round the cup and
back to the handle, it shows that he will return; if they end before getting
back to the handle, and especially if a resemblance to a house appears where the
journey line ends, it betokens removal to some other place. If the consultant be
away from home, lines leading to the handle show a return home, and if free from
crosses or other symbols of delay that the return will be speedy: otherwise it
will be postponed. The occurrence of a numeral may indicate the number of days,
or if in connection with a number of small dots grouped around the sign of a
letter, a present or a legacy, the amount of the remittance in the former, the
number of presents to be expected, or the amount of the legacy coming. Dots
surrounding a symbol always indicate money coming in some form or other,
according to the nature of the symbol.</p>

<p>It will be seen that to read a fortune in the tea-cup with any real approach
to accuracy and a serious attempt to derive a genuine forecast from the cup the
seer must not be in a hurry. He or she must not only study the general
appearance of the horoscope displayed before him, and decide upon the
resemblance of the groups of leaves to natural or artificial objects, each of
which possesses a separate significance, but must also balance the bad and good,
the lucky and unlucky symbols, and strike an average. For instance, a large
bouquet of flowers, which is a fortunate sign, would outweigh in importance one
or two minute crosses, which in this case would merely signify some small delay
in the realisation of success; whereas one large cross in a prominent position
would be a warning of disaster that would be little, if at all, mitigated by the
presence of small isolated flowers, however lucky individually these may be.
This is on the same principle as that by which astrologers judge a horoscope,
when, after computing the aspects of the planets towards each other, the Sun and
Moon, the Ascendant, Mid-heaven, and the significator of the Native, they
balance the good aspects against the bad, the strong against the weak, the
Benefics against the Malefics, and so strike an average. In a similar way the
lucky and unlucky, signs in a tea-cup must be balanced one against the other and
an average struck: and in this connection it may be pointed out that symbols
which stand out clearly and distinctly by themselves are of more importance than
those with difficulty to be discerned amid cloudlike masses of shapeless leaves.
When these clouds obscure or surround a lucky sign they weaken its force, and
vice versa. In tea-cup reading, however, the fortune told must be regarded
chiefly as of a horary character, not, as with an astrological horoscope, that
of a whole life; and where it is merely indulged in as a light amusement to
while away a few minutes after a meal such nicety of judgment is not called for.
The seer will just glance at the cup, note the sign for a letter from someone,
or that for a journey to the seaside or the proximity of a gift, or an offer of
marriage, and pass on to another cup.</p>

<p>It should be observed that some cups when examined will present no features
of interest, or will be so clouded and muddled that no clear meaning is to be
read in them. In such a case the seer should waste no time over them. Either the
consultant has not concentrated his or her attention upon the business in hand
when turning the cup, or his destiny is so obscured by the indecision of his
mind or the vagueness of his ideas that it is unable to manifest itself by
symbols. Persons who consult the tea-leaves too frequently often find this
muddled state of things to supervene. Probably once a week will be often enough
to look into the future, although there is something to be said for the Highland
custom of examining the leaves of the morning cup of tea in order to obtain
some insight into the events the day may be expected to bring forth. To 'look in
the cup' three or four times a day, as some silly folk do, is simply to ask for
contradictory manifestations and consequent bewilderment, and is symptomatic of
the idle, empty, bemused minds that prompt to such ill-advised conduct.</p>

<p>Of course the tea-cup may be employed solely for the purpose of asking what
is known to astrologers as 'a horary question', such, for instance, as 'Shall I
hear from my lover in France, and when?' In this case the attention of the
consultant when turning the cup must be concentrated solely on this single
point, and the seer will regard the shapes taken by the tea-leaves solely in
this connection in order to give a definite and satisfactory answer. An example
of this class of horary question is included among the illustrations (Fig. 10).</p>

<a name="4"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV </p>
<p>AN ALPHABETICAL LIST OF SYMBOLS WITH THEIR SIGNIFICATIONS </p>

<p>A question that will very naturally occur to persons of an enquiring turn of
mind in regard to the figures and symbols seen in the tea-cup is: Why should
one symbol necessarily signify one thing and not something quite different?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that the meanings given to the symbols are purely
arbitrary, and that there is no scientific reason why one should signify one
thing and not another. There is no real reason why the ace of clubs, for
instance, should not be considered the 'House Card' instead of the nine of
hearts, or why the double four in dominoes should signify an invitation instead
of a wedding, like the double three.</p>

<p>It is obviously necessary, however, in attempting to read the future by means
of any kind of symbols, whether pips, dots, numbers or anything else, to fix
beforehand upon some definite meaning to be attributed to each separate symbol
and to hold fast to this meaning in all events. In the case of tea-leaves, where
the symbols are not mere 'conventional signs' or numbers but actual figures like
the pictures seen in the fire or those envisaged in dreams, there is no doubt
that the signification of most of them is the result of empyrical experience.
Generations of spae-wives have found that the recurrence of a certain figure in
the cup has corresponded with the occurrence of a certain event in the future
lives of the various persons who have consulted them: and this empyrical
knowledge has been handed down from seer to seer until a sufficient deposit of
tradition has been formed from which it has been found possible to compile a
detailed list of the most important symbols and to attach to each a traditional
meaning. These significations have been collected by the writer&#8212;in a desultory
manner&#8212;over a long period of years chiefly from spae-wives in both Highland and
Lowland Scotland, but also in Cornwall, on Dartmoor, in Middle England, in
Gloucestershire and Northumberland. Occasionally it has been found that a
different meaning is attributed to a symbol by one seer from that given it by
another. In such cases an alternative signification might, of course, have been
given here, but as the essence of all such significations is that they shall be
stable and unvarying, the writer has fixed upon whichever meaning has been most
widely attributed to the symbol or appears to have the best authority for its
adoption, so that the element of doubt may be excluded.</p>

<p>Although included in their alphabetical order in the list which follows,
there are certain figures and symbols which are of so common occurrence and bear
such definite interpretation that it is advisable to refer to them here in
detail. Certain symbols are invariably signs of approaching good-fortune:
certain others of threatened ill-luck. Among the former may be mentioned
triangles, stars, trefoil or clover-leaves, anchors, trees, garlands and
flowers, bridges or arches, and crowns. Among the latter, coffins, clouds,
crosses, serpents, rats and mice and some wild beasts, hour-glasses, umbrellas,
church-steeples, swords and guns, ravens, owls, and monkeys are all ominous
symbols.</p>

<p>A COLLECTION OF SPECIMEN CUPS, WITH INTERPRETATIONS</p>

<p>The succeeding ten figures are copied from actual tea-cups that have been at
different times subjected to the proper ritual by various consultants and duly
interpreted by seers. They are selected out of a larger number as being
representative of many different classes of horoscope, and they should afford
students practical instruction in what symbols to look for, and how to discern
them clearly as they turn the cup about and about in their hands.</p>

<p>By reference to the interpretations provided upon the pages facing the
illustrations he will be able to ascertain the principles upon which to form a
judgment of the cup generally; and this, once he has mastered the method, he
will be able to supplement, by consulting the alphabetical list of symbols and
their significations in the previous chapter, and in this way will speedily
attain proficiency in reading any tea-cup presented for his consideration.</p>

<p>INTERPRETATIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS</p>

<a name="1i"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>FIG.1</p>
</center>
<p>This is a fortunate horoscope. If cup has been turned by a man it shows that
he will gain success, honour, and wealth in the profession of a naval officer.
If by a woman then her luck is bound up with that of a sailor or marine.</p>

<p>The pistols on the sides show the profession of arms, and the naval gun in
the bottom of the cup accompanied by a trident the branch to which he belongs.
The on one side and the tree on the other are two of the best signs of
promotion, rewards, and prosperity. The house near the pistol pointing towards
the handle of the cup indicates the acquisition of property, but as neither tree
nor house are surrounded by dots this will be a town, not a country, residence.
The repetition of the initial 'L' may show the name of the admiral, ship, or
battle in which the officer will win renown. The triangles confirm the other
signs of good fortune.</p>

<p>INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>FIG. 2</p>
</center>

<p>There is nothing very significant in this tea-cup. The wavy lines denote a
troublesome journey leading to some small amount of luck in connection with a
person or place whose name begins with the initial 'E.' The hour-glass near the
rim and the place from which the journey starts denotes that it will be
undertaken in order to avoid some imminent peril. The numeral '4' conjoined with
the sign of a parcel shows that one may be expected in that number of days.</p>

<p>This shows, by means of the crescent moon on the side, prosperity and fortune
as the result of a journey denoted by the lines. The number of triangles in conjunction
with the initial 'H' indicates the name commences with that letter,
and, being near the rim, at no great distance of time. The bird flying towards
and near the handle, accompanied by a triangle and a long envelope, denotes good
news from an official source. The flag gives warning of some danger from an
enemy.</p>

<p>The consultant is about to journey eastward to some large building or
institution, shown by the figure at the end of the straight line of dots. There
is some confusion in his or her affairs caused by too much indulgence in
pleasure and gaiety, denoted by the butterfly involved in obscure groups of
tea-leaves near the handle. The tree and the fleur-de-lys (or lily) in the
bottom of the cup are, however, signs of eventual success, probably through the
assistance of some person whose name begins with an 'N.'</p>

<p>A letter is approaching the consultant containing a considerable sum of
money, as it is surrounded by dots. The future, shown by the bottom of the cup,
is not clear, and betokens adversities; but the presence of the hammer there
denotes triumph over these, a sign confirmed by the hat on the side. The
consultant will be annoyed by somebody whose name begins with 'J,' and assisted
by one bearing the initial 'Y.'</p>

<p>A letter containing good news, shown by bird flying and the triangle, may be
expected immediately. If from a lover it shows that he is constant and
prosperous, owing to the anchor on the side. The large tree on the side
indicates happiness and prosperity. A letter will be received from someone whose
initial is 'L.' In the bottom of the cup there are signs of minor vexations or
delays in connection with someone whose name begins with 'C.'</p>

<p>The two horse-shoes indicate a lucky journey to some large residence in a
north-easterly direction, the tree surmounting which denotes that happiness and
fortune will be found there and that (as it is surrounded by dots) it is
situated in the country. The sitting hen in the bottom of the cup, surmounted by
a triangle (to see which properly the illustration must be turned round) is
indicative of increased wealth by an unexpected legacy. A letter from someone
whose name begins with 'T' will contain a remittance of money, but it may not
arrive for some little time.</p>

<p>This tea-cup appears to give warning by the flag in conjunction with a rifle
and the letter 'V' that some friend of the consultant will be wounded in
battle, and as there is a coffin in the bottom of the cup that the wounds will
be fatal. On the other side, however, a sceptre, surrounded by signs of honours,
seems to indicate that 'V' will be recognized by his sovereign and a decoration
bestowed upon him for bravery in battle, shown by the initial 'K' accompanied by
a letter-sign, and by the astrological sign of Mars, intervening between these
and the sceptre.</p>

</center>

<p>If the consultant be single this cup will, by means of the hare on the side,
tell him that he will speedily be married. The figure of a lady holding out an
ivy-leaf is a sign that his sweetheart will prove true and constant, and the
heart in conjunction with a ring and the initial 'A' still further points to
marriage with a person whose name begins with that letter. The flower, triangle,
and butterfly are all signs of prosperity, pleasure and happiness.</p>

that nothing very important is about to happen to the consultant.</p>

<p>OMENS</p>

<p>How have omens been regarded in the past? An appeal to anciency is usually a
safeguard for a basis. It is found that most of the earliest records are now
subsisting. See official guide to the British Museum. Babylonian and Assyrian
antiquities, table case H. Nineveh Gallery, the following appears:</p>

<p>&quot;By means of omen tablets the Babylonian and Assyrian priests from time
immemorial predicted events which they believed would happen in the near or in
the remote future. They deduced these omens from the appearance and actions of
animals, birds, fish, and reptiles; from the appearance of the entrails of
sacrificial victims; from the appearance and condition of human and animal
offspring at birth; from the state and condition of various members of the human
body.&quot;</p>

<p>In India, where the records of the early ages of civilization go back
hundreds of years, omens are considered of great importance.</p>

<p>Later, in Greece, the home of the greatest and highest culture and
civilization, we find, too, omens regarded very seriously, while to-day there
are vast numbers of persons of intellect, the world over, who place reliance
upon omens.</p>

<p>That there is some good ground for belief in some omens seems indisputable.
Whether this has arisen as the result of experience, by the following of some
particular event close upon the heels of signs observed, or whether it has been
an intuitive science, in which provision has been used to afford an
interpretation, is not quite clear. It seems idle to attempt to dismiss the
whole thing as mere superstition, wild guessing, or abject credulity, as some
try to do, with astrology and alchemy also, and other occult sciences; the fact
remains that omens have, in numberless instances, given good warnings.</p>

<p>To say that these are just coincidences is to beg the question. For the
universe is governed by law. Things happen because they must, not because they
may. There is no such thing as accident or coincidence. We may not be able to
see the steps and the connections. But they are there all the same.</p>

<p>In years gone by many signs were deduced from the symptoms of sick men; the
events or actions of a man's life; dreams and visions; the appearance of a man's
shadow; from fire, flame, light, or smoke; the state and condition of cities and
their streets, of fields, marshes, rivers, and lands. From the appearances of
the stars and planets, of eclipses, meteors, shooting stars, the direction of
winds, the form of clouds, thunder and lightning and other weather incidents,
they were able to forecast happenings. A number of tablets are devoted to these
prophecies.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that many of these omens should have found their way into
Greece, and it is not unreasonable to believe that India may have derived her
knowledge of omens from Babylonia; or it may have been the other way about. The
greatest of scholars are divided in their opinions as to which really is the
earlier civilization.</p>

<p>The point to be made here is that in all parts of the world&#8212;in quarters where
we may be certain that no trace of Grecian, Indian, or Babylonian science or
civilization has appeared&#8212;there are to be found systems of prophecies by omens.</p>

<p>It may be accounted for in two ways. One that in all races as they grow up,
so to speak, there is the same course of evolution of ideas and superstition
which to many appears childish. The other explanation seems to be the more
reasonable one, if we believe, as we are forced to do, that omens do
foretell&#8212;that all peoples, all races, accumulate a record, oral or otherwise, of
things which have happened more or less connected with things which seemed to
indicate them. In course of time this knowledge appears to consolidate. It gets
generally accepted as true. And then it is handed on from generation to
generation. Often with the passage of years it gets twisted and a new meaning
taken out of it altogether different from the original.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to attempt to classify omens. Many books have been
written on the subject and more yet to be written of the beliefs of the various
races. The best that can be offered here is a selection from one or other of the
varied sources. In Greece sneezing was a good omen and was considered a proof of
the truth of what was said at the moment by the sneezer.</p>

<p>A tingling in the hand denoted the near handling of money, a ringing in the
ears that news will soon be received. The number of sneezes then became a sign
for more definite results. The hand which tingled, either right or left,
indicated whether it were to be paid or received. The particular ear affected
was held to indicate good or evil news. Other involuntary movements of the body
were also considered of prime importance.</p>

<p>Many omens are derived from the observation of various substances dropped
into a bowl of water. In Babylon oil was used. To-day in various countries
melted lead, wax, or the white of an egg, is used. From the shapes which
result, the trade or occupation of a future husband, the luck for the year, and
so on, are deduced in the folk practices of modern Europe. Finns use stearine
and melted lead, Magyars lead, Russians wax, Danes lead and egg, and the
northern counties of England egg, wax and oil.</p>

<p>Bird omens were the subject of very serious study in Greece. It has been
thought that this was because in the early mythology of Greece some of their
gods and goddesses were believed to have been birds. Birds, therefore, were
particularly sacred, and their appearances and movements were of profound
significance. The principal birds for signs were the raven, the crow, the heron,
wren, dove, woodpecker, and kingfisher, and all the birds of prey, such as the
hawk, eagle, or vulture, which the ancients classed together (W. R. Halliday,
&quot;Greek Divination&quot;). Many curious instances, which were fulfilled, of bird omens
are related in &quot;The Other World,&quot; by Rev. F. Lee. A number of families have
traditions about the appearance of a white bird in particular.</p>

<p>&quot;In the ancient family of Ferrers, of Chartley Park, in Staffordshire, a herd
of wild cattle is preserved. A tradition arose in the time of Henry III. that
the birth of a parti-coloured calf is a sure omen of death, within the same
year, to a member of the Lord Ferrers family. By a noticeable coincidence, a
calf of this description has been born whenever a death has happened of late
years in this noble family.&quot; (<i>Staffordshire Chronicle</i>, July, 1835). The falling
of a picture or a statue or bust of the individual is usually regarded as an
evil omen. Many cases are cited where this has been soon followed by the death
of the person.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply instances of this sort: of personal omen or
warning. The history and traditions of our great families are saturated with it.
The predictions and omens relating to certain well known families, and others,
recur at once; and from these it may be inferred that beneath the more popular
beliefs there is enough fire and truth to justify the smoke that is produced,
and to reward some of the faith that is placed in the modern dreambooks and the
books of fate and the interpretations of omens.</p>


<p>OMENS</p>

<p>ACORN.&#8212;Falling from the oak tree on anyone, is a sign of good fortune to the
person it strikes.</p>

<p>BAT.&#8212;To see one in day time means long journey.</p>

<p>BIRTHDAYS.&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Monday's child is fair of face, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday's child is full of
grace, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday's child is full of woe, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday's child has far to go,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday's child is loving and giving, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's child works hard for its living;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a child that's born on the Sabbath-day <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is handsome and wise and loving and
gay.&quot;</p>

<p>BUTTERFLY.&#8212;In your room means great pleasure and success, but you must not
catch it, or the luck will change.</p>

<p>CANDLE.&#8212;A spark on the wick of a candle means a letter for the one who first
sees it. A big glow like a parcel means money coming to you.</p>

<p>CAT.&#8212;Black cat to come to your house means difficulties caused by treachery.
Drive it away and avoid trouble.</p>

<p>CHAIN.&#8212;If your chain breaks while on you means disappointments or a broken
engagement of marriage.</p>

<p>CLOTHES.&#8212;To put on clothes the wrong way out is a sign of good luck; but you
must not alter them, or the luck will change.</p>

<p>CLOVER.&#8212;To find a four-leaf clover means luck to you, happiness and
prosperity.</p>

<p>COW.&#8212;Coming in your yard or garden a very prosperous sign.</p>

<p>CRICKETS.&#8212;A lucky omen. It foretells money coming to you. They should not be
disturbed.</p>

<p>DOG.&#8212;Coming to your house, means faithful friends and a favourable sign.</p>

<p>DEATH-WATCH.&#8212;A clicking in the wall by this little insect is regarded as
evil, but it does not necessarily mean a death; possibly only some sickness.</p>

<p>EARS.&#8212;You are being talked about if your ear tingles. Some say, &quot;right for
spite, left for love.&quot; Others reverse this omen. If you think of the person,
friend, or acquaintance who is likely to be talking of you, and mention the name
aloud, the tingling will cease if you say the right one.</p>

<p>FLAG.&#8212;If it falls from the staff, while flying it means danger from wounds
inflicted by an enemy.</p>

<p>FRUIT STONES OR PIPS.&#8212;Think of a wish first, and then count your stones or
pips. If the number is even, the omen is good. If odd, the reverse is the case.</p>

<p>GRASSHOPPER in the house means some great friend or distinguished person will
visit you.</p>

<p>HORSESHOE.&#8212;To find one means it will bring you luck.</p>

<p>KNIVES crossed are a bad omen. If a knife or fork or scissors falls to the
ground and sticks in the floor you will have a visitor.</p>

<p>LADYBIRDS betoken visitors.</p>

<p>LOOKING GLASS.&#8212;To break means it will bring you ill luck.</p>

<p>MAGPIES.&#8212;One, bad luck; two, good luck; three, a wedding; four, a birth.</p>

<p>MARRIAGE.&#8212;A maid should not wear colours; a widow never white. Happy omens
for brides are sunshine and a cat sneezing.</p>

<p>MAY.&#8212;&quot;Marry in May, and you'll rue the day.&quot;</p>

<p>NEW MOON on a Monday signifies good luck and good weather. The new moon seen
for the first time over the right shoulder offers the chance for a wish to come
true.</p>

<p>NIGHTINGALE.&#8212;Lucky for lovers if heard before the cuckoo.</p>

<p>OWLS are evil omens. Continuous hooting of owls in your trees is said to be
one of ill-health.</p>

<p>PIGS.&#8212;To meet a sow coming towards you is good; but if she turns away, the
luck flies.</p>

<p>RABBITS.&#8212;A rabbit running across your path is said to be unlucky.</p>

<p>RAT.&#8212;A rat running in front of you means treacherous servants and losses
through enemies.</p>

<p>RAVEN.&#8212;To see one, means death to the aged or trouble generally.</p>

<p>SALT spilled means a quarrel. This may be avoided by throwing a pinch over
the left shoulder.</p>

<p>SCISSORS.&#8212;If they fall and stick in the floor it means quarrels, illness,
separation of lovers.</p>

<p>SERPENT OR SNAKE.&#8212;If it crosses your path, means spiteful enemies, bad luck.
Kill it and your luck will be reversed.</p>

<p>SHOES.&#8212;The right shoe is the best one to put on first.</p>

<p>SHOOTING STARS.&#8212;If you wish, while the star is still moving, your wish will
come true.</p>

<p>SINGING before breakfast, you'll cry before night.</p>

<p>SPIDERS.&#8212;The little red spider is the money spider, and means good fortune
coming to you. It must not be disturbed. Long-legged spiders are also
forerunners of good fortune.</p>

<p>TOWEL.&#8212;To wipe your hands on a towel at the same time with another, means
you are to quarrel with him or her in the near future.</p>

<p>WHEEL.&#8212;The wheel coming off any vehicle you are riding in means you are to
inherit some fortune, a good omen.</p>

<p>WASHING HANDS.&#8212;If you wash your hands in the water just used by another, a
quarrel may be expected, unless you first make the sign of the cross over the
water.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
